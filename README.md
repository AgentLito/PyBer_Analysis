Summary

The urban city rides make more revenue than the rural area but rural city rides are more profitable than the urban area.
So, it would be great to focus on improvising the plan to make urban cities rides more profitable.
Also, it would be great to focus on drivers count, though urban cities have less rides than the drivers count.
Increase the per mile charges in urban cities because there are more short trips and Average fare per driver is less.
To increase the drivers count , they can charge more to drivers who is consistence in their work.
